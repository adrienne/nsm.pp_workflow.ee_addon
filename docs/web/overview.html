<p>NSM Publish Plus: Workflow is ideal for websites that require it's entries to be reviewed on a regular basis and takes away the hassle of manually auditing the content thanks to the module dashboard.</p>

All you need is a <a href="/nsm-publish-plus-workflow/tutorial#toc-automating_entry_reviews">CRON job to ping a URL</a> to trigger the review process.
